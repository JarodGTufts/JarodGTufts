            <p>Born and raised in Portland, OR, I grew up surrounded by mechanical hobbies and a desire to create. In high school I became fascinated with 3D modelling and 3D printing, but until I came to Tufts it was nothing more than a side-hobby.</p>

            <p>Once I reached Tufts, I dove deeper into my fascination with 3D printing through the Makerspace on campus, and eventually secured a formative intenrship at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in the summer after my freshman year. There, I was exposed daily to a series of 3D printers, while explaining the exciting technology to visitors.</p>
            
            <p>This positive experience in technology, paired with a series of exciting classes in computer science taken during my Freshman and Sophomore years, convinced me to put aside my previous goal of a major in Biology and turn towards Computer Science. This past summer, working at a 3D printing company called Markforged as a software engineer, I saw the fusion of many of my passions; computer science, problem solving, and 3D printing.</p>
